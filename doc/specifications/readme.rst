Preamble
========

The time has come for some use cases in Solve-O-Matic: to help define what 
we're trying to do here and from that determine the direction to take. This 
is a project with a fair amount of potential it seems, so some care now will
hopefully pay in the future.

These use cases are formatted in reStructuredText: this is essentially a text
file where a couple of rules are set, so that a Python script can read it and
transmogrify the results to latex (and hence PDF) or HTML.

Use Cases
=========

The following use cases are defined:

- Difference map calculation: the "ligand pipeline"

- Assessment of heavy atom substructure *via* SHELXD CC weak
