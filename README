Solve-o-Matic
-------------

A swiss army knife of structure solution tools, which will vary in speed and
quality, and aim to allow on-line structure solution for MX (i.e. phasing and 
model building.) Clearly this will build on some software, including but not 
limited to:

 - CCP4 
 - PHENIX
 - CCTBX
 - SHELX
